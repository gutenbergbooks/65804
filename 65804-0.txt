                      Electric Cooking in General


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Q. Do I Have to Learn to Cook All Over Again to Cook with
      Electricity?

  A. Of course not! Just use your same favorite recipes (and many
  others) with confidence and ease—the only difference will be that your
  electric range will give you greater simplicity and accuracy, and add
  greater joy to cooking because it is cleaner, cooler and automatic.

2. Q. Is Cooking by Electricity Expensive?

  A. In most sections of the country electrical cookery is no more
  expensive than other methods, often less expensive. In fact most
  modern electric ranges as produced by reliable manufacturers are
  designed and engineered for economical operation.

3. Q. Approximately How Much Does It Cost an Average Family to Operate
      an Electric Range?

  A. Reproduced here is a table giving approximate electrical cooking
  costs compiled from the experience of electric range users in all
  parts of the country.

     Electric Cooking Rate In Your     Number of People in the Family
      Locality (Per Kilowatt Hour)

                                           2     3     4     5     6
                                    1c  $.56  $.72  $.84  $.95 $1.02
                                   1¼c   .70   .90  1.05  1.19  1.28
                                   1½c   .84  1.08  1.26  1.43  1.53
                                   1¾c   .98  1.26  1.47  1.66  1.79
                                    2c  1.12  1.44  1.68  1.90  2.04
         2¼c (Ave. Elec. Cooking Rate)  1.26  1.62  1.89  2.14  2.30
                                   2½c  1.40  1.80  2.10  2.38  2.55
                                   2¾c  1.54  1.98  2.31  2.61  2.81
                                    3c  1.68  2.16  2.52  2.85  3.06

4. Q. Is It Expensive to Pre-heat Such a Large Oven?

  A. No. It costs approximately 1¼c to pre-heat a large electric oven to
  the average baking or roasting temperature—(350°F) and much of this
  heat is conserved during baking or roasting by the oven insulation.
  Actually, the current is on only a part of the time that the oven is
  in use.

5. Q. What About the Safety of an Electric Range?

  A. All reputable electric ranges are inspected, tested and approved by
  the Underwriter Laboratories for fire and casualty hazards and must
  comply with their rigid standards. As a matter of general practice and
  recommendation of manufacturers, frames and all non-electrical parts
  are grounded to insure against becoming electrically alive while in
  use. All electrical parts are shielded and insulated to protect
  against accidental contact.

6. Q. Can Cooking be Continued with Safety During an Electrical Storm?

  A. Yes, completely. Due to the reasons of safety mentioned above.

7. Q. What Happens if a Switch Is Turned On and Left On By Mistake?

  A. Current will be wasted, that’s all. The oven cannot overheat
  because automatic controls prevent this. The surface units can be left
  on at high speed for days without damage to the unit or without
  hazard.

8. Q. Is There Any Hazard Involved By Leaving the Electric Oven
      Operating During My Absence?

  A. No. You can place an entire meal in the oven and leave the house
  for the afternoon, and the range will automatically cook the dinner
  and turn off the heat at the proper time if the range is equipped with
  an automatic time control. Should you arrive home later than planned
  the oven will have retained sufficient heat for a reasonable length of
  time to keep the dinner warm enough for immediate serving.

9. Q. What Happens if Power Failure Occurs?

  A. Experience indicates that power failures are negligible. And, even
  should they occur, there is no danger from the electric range. Only
  the inconvenience of being without the use of the range during the
  period the power is off.

                 Surface Cooking on the Electric Range


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Q. Do the “Definite” _Surface_ Heats Provided by Most Electric
      Ranges, Have Any Advantages Over the “Infinite” Number of Surface
      Heats Provided by Ranges Using Other Fuels?

  A. Yes. This is important because it eliminates “guesswork” in cooking
  and enables you to use even unfamiliar recipes with confidence and
  ease. The heat obtained at each switch setting will be repeated
  exactly each time you use it.

2. Q. How Many Surface Heats Should be Provided for Best Results?

  A. Most ranges have five surface heats described here, and these have
  been found adequate for every cooking need.

3. Q. What Is the Use for Surface “High” Heat?

  A. “High” heat is always used to bring foods quickly to steaming
  point. (As soon as cooking temperatures are reached one of the lower
  heats is used to continue and complete that cooking.) It is used to
  preheat fat for frying and used continuously for deep fat frying of
  potatoes. “High” heat is always used for speed in heating water.

    [Illustration: _High_]

4. Q. What Is the Use for the Surface “Medium-High” Heat?

  A. “Medium-high” provides the right temperature for frying chicken or
  browning meats and for maintaining cooking of large quantities of food
  in extra large utensils. “Medium-high” on small units can be used for
  baking griddle cakes when a small utensil is used.

    [Illustration: _Medium High_]

5. Q. When Do You Use the Surface “Medium-Low” Heat?

  A. “Medium-low” is just right for percolating coffee or for heating
  small quantities of food quickly.

    [Illustration: _Medium Low_]

6. Q. How Is “Low” Heat Used?

  A. “Low” heat is used for keeping foods cooking after they have been
  started on “high” heat. This low heat is sufficient for keeping quite
  a large quantity of vegetables and other foods actively cooking.

    [Illustration: _Low_]

7. Q. How Is “Simmer” Heat Used?

  A. “Simmer” heat is used for low temperature cooking, for instance,
  small quantities of vegetables, cooking custards, sauces and dried
  fruits. The uses for “low” and “simmer” heats are much the same
  excepting “low” is used for larger quantities of foods.

    [Illustration: _Simmer_]

8. Q. Why Is Low Water Cooking Recommended for Vegetables?

  A. Because more food value is retained, also flavor and appearance is
  better. Very little water need be added to vegetables to create the
  necessary steam for proper cooking.

9. Q. Which of the Five Surface Heats Is Most Practical to Use in Making
      Coffee?

  A. “Medium-low” on either the large or small unit, depending upon the
  size percolator and amount of coffee to be made.

10. Q. Is the Deep Well Cooker More Practical Than a Fourth Surface
      Unit?

  A. Yes, because the deep well cooker will perform virtually any
  cooking operation possible on a surface unit, plus baking, and do many
  of them better and more economically.

11. Q. What Types of Food Are Best Prepared in the Deep Well Cooker?

  A. Pot roasts, soups, stews and any foods requiring long cooking
  times.

12. Q. What Are Some Uses for the Deep Well Cooker?

  A. Steaming puddings, baking, simmering dried fruits and cooking
  tougher cuts of meats. As a utensil it can be used for sterilizing.

13. Q. Do Flavors Mingle When Several Foods Are Cooked at One Time in
      the Deep Well Cooker?

  A. No—If you will remember to do one thing—always remove the foods
  from the cooker as soon as the current is turned off. While foods are
  cooking they are “exhaling” their odors. When they begin to cool they
  begin to “inhale” and absorb the odors of other foods.

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

14. Q. Can the Deep Well Cooker Be Used for Steaming Brown Bread,
      Puddings, etc.?

  A. Yes, by pouring water in the bottom of the cooker and using a
  “trivet” or rack.

15. Q. Can the Deep Well Cooker Be Used for Baking?

  A. Yes. It is economical for baking several potatoes, cup custards or
  baked apples. When the cooker well is used for baking the cooker
  utensil is removed and a rack placed in the well. The well is heated
  to proper baking temperature with the switch on “high” and baking is
  continued on “low” heat.

16. Q. How Can the Deep Well Cooker Be Used as a Warming Oven?

  A. Remove the utensil. Place the rack in the well and cover with the
  lid of the cooker. “Low” heat provides sufficient heat for warming.

17. Q. Can the Deep Well Cooker Utensil Be Used on the Surface Unit?

  A. Yes.

18. Q. Does Food Cook as Fast in a Deep Well Cooker?

  A. Yes. It is ideal for soups, stews, pot roasts, etc., which require
  uniform low temperatures over longer periods for best cooking results.

19. Q. Why Are Deep Well Cookers Usually Insulated?

  A. Many foods prepared in the deep well cooker are those requiring
  long cooking periods. Because of adequate insulation less current is
  used. For example, the insulation on deep well cookers makes it
  possible to prepare an entire meal at a total current cost of less
  than two cents. (Based on an electric cooking rate of two-and-a-half
  cents per kilowatt.)




                     Using the Electric Range Oven


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Q. How Long Does It Take to Preheat the Electric Oven for Baking?

  A. From seven to fifteen minutes is usually required for preheating to
  a temperature of 350°F. (In one make of Range, two units provide
  correct baking heat and fast preheating to _400°F_ in _less_ than
  seven minutes.)

2. Q. How Can the User Determine When the Oven Has Reached the
      Temperature She Desires for Baking or Roasting?

  A. This is easily determined by the oven signal light which goes out
  when the oven reaches the desired temperature.

3. Q. Is It Necessary to Preheat the Electric Oven for Baking?

  A. No, however, for time-saving the oven should be preheated.

4. Q. Should the Oven Always be Preheated for Oven Meals?

  A. This depends on the type of oven meal. For example, there are many
  combinations of foods which can be placed in the oven and remain there
  several hours before cooking is started and which do not require
  preheat. Other types of oven meals require cooking immediately as soon
  as they are prepared and better results are obtained from a preheated
  oven.

5. Q. If Four Baking Pans Are Put Into an Electric Oven at One Time, How
      Should They Be Placed to Allow for Even Heat Distribution?

  A. The pans should be placed so they are not touching each other, or
  any part of the oven. Since this usually means using two shelves, the
  pans should be staggered, so one is not directly above the other.

6. Q. Why Is It Not Necessary to “Peek” Into an Electric Oven During
      Roasting or Baking?

  A. Because with accurate electric controls, much of the uncertainty of
  cooking has been eliminated. Even if the recipe that you are using is
  questionable, do not “peek” until the required baking time has passed.

7. Q. Why Do You Recommend Roasting in an Open Shallow Pan Without the
      Addition of Water?

  A. A shallow pan allows the heat from the oven to contact the food
  more directly. With the even penetration of heat, meat will cook more
  uniformly.

8. Q. Why Is There So Little Shrinkage and “Drying-out” of Meats Cooked
      in an Electric Range?

  A. Because electricity does not require additional air for fuel
  combustion, there is no excess air circulation to absorb moisture and
  carry it out of the oven.

9. Q. How Does an Oven Clock Control Work?

  A. Simply set the automatic clock control at the time you want the
  current to go on and at the time you want the cooking operation to
  stop. Set the thermostat at a given temperature and the range will
  automatically perform the desired cooking operation.

10. Q. Are All Ranges Equipped With Time Clocks Automatically
      Controlling the Oven Operation?

  A. No. This is a feature usually included as standard equipment on
  higher priced models. It can be added as an accessory to many of the
  lower priced models.

11. Q. Is It Possible to Operate an Electric Range Oven at Low
      Temperature, Such as 200°F?

  A. Thermostatic controls are capable of operating at temperatures as
  low as 150°F. on practically all electric ranges.

12. Q. What Is the Maximum Temperature at Which Electric Range Ovens Can
      Be Automatically Controlled?

  A. Nearly all electric ovens will heat to 550°F. This is above
  required baking temperatures, yet it avoids danger of burning foods
  which would of course be possible at higher temperatures. The
  thermostat is always set at this maximum temperature when broiling is
  done to avoid having the broiling unit cut off during the cooking
  operation.

13. Q. What Is the Advantage of Having the Oven Vent Open on the Front
      of the Back Panel?

  A. First, you can place the range flush against the wall without
  damaging the wall paper or curtains. Second, the top vent prevents
  moisture from collecting in the top of the oven. Accordingly the
  housewife is assured that cakes baked on the upper shelf will not be
  soggy but will turn out as beautifully browned as those baked on lower
  shelves. Third, no flue pipe is necessary.

14. Q. Why Do Most Electric Ovens Have Shelf Type Doors?

  A. This type of door cannot sag, as do swing doors, thus creating
  drafts of cold air within the oven. Also, they serve as a convenient
  shelf in placing pans in, or taking them out of the oven.

15. Q. Can the User Depend on an Electric Oven Thermostatic Control?

  A. The hydraulic type control is so designed that the bulb can be
  placed in the desired oven position to insure accurate temperatures
  while the control knob can be located in that position which is most
  convenient for the user.

16. Q. Does the Automatic Oven Control Increase Economy for Electric
      Range Users?

  A. Yes. By providing no more heat than is needed to maintain the
  required temperature this control avoids waste of electricity.

17. Q. Some Electric Ranges Have Two Units for Heating the Oven. Others
      Only Have One. What Is the Essential Difference?

  A. First, two units give a greater degree of flexibility and a more
  even distribution of heat throughout the oven. Also, they allow the
  use of the upper unit for broiling in a more convenient position. The
  single unit oven is not as convenient because broiling is done on the
  lower part of the oven and it lacks the type of heat distribution made
  possible by two units.

18. Q. Does the Electric Oven Give Off Much Heat in the Kitchen During
      Baking or Roasting?

  A. Because electric heating elements require no air supply for
  combustion, the oven is completely insulated on all six sides, thus
  giving off practically no heat.

19. Q. Should the Broiler Pan Be Heated Before Broiling Is Started?

  A. No. A hot broiler pan is many times responsible for excess smoking
  because of fat drippings from the meat striking the hot broiler pan.

20. Q. How Is Broiling Speed Regulated?

  A. Broiling speed is regulated by raising or lowering the position of
  the broiler pan in the oven. For fast broiling, place on oven shelf
  located close to heating unit. This will produce results very similar
  to charcoal broiling. For lower temperature or slower broiling, lower
  the oven shelf so that top surface of food will be 2½ or 3 inches from
  the broiling unit, and allow slightly more time for broiling.

21. Q. Are Broiler Meals Popular?

  A. Yes. Much of the original flavor is retained in the food by this
  method of cooking. For example, meat and fruits may be placed on the
  broiler pan and cooked. The vegetable can be placed in the pan below
  the broiler rack. The cooked vegetable will be heated while the food
  on the rack is broiled.

22. Q. Is It Advisable to Use the Broiler Pan for Roasting?

  A. Yes, the broiler pan is a convenient utensil for use in roasting.

23. Q. For Best Results, Should Frozen Meats Be Entirely Defrosted
      Before Cooking?

  A. Acceptable cooking results may be obtained either way. However, if
  meat is allowed to thaw, cooking time can be judged more accurately;
  also thick steaks broil more uniformly if allowed to thaw. Meat to be
  thawed may be placed on the shelf of your household refrigerator
  without removing the wrapping.

  If it is more convenient to cook without thawing, the meat should be
  cooked for a longer period of time than usual at a slightly lower
  temperature. A thick steak cooking from the frozen condition may
  appear cooked, but actually be cold and raw in the center. Generally
  meats that are cooked from the frozen condition should be cooked half
  again as long as thawed meats, and sometime longer. It isn’t easy to
  figure cooking time, the length of time will depend, of course, upon
  the kind of meat and whether you want it rare, medium or well done.
  See the charts on pages 23 and 24 for a guide in cooking frozen foods.




                     Utility of the Electric Range


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Q. Are All Electric Ranges Equipped With a Warming Drawer?

  A. No. It is usually a regular feature on deluxe models and can be
  installed as an accessory on some other models.

2. Q. Are the Temperatures in the Warming Drawer Harmful to China?

  A. No. The temperature is sufficient for warming china but not high
  enough to cause any harm.

3. Q. Are the Warming Drawer Temperatures Adequate for Keeping Food Warm
      for Serving?

  A. Yes. A common practice is that of placing fresh baked rolls in the
  warming drawer for serving during the dinner period.

4. Q. Do All Ranges Have Storage Space for Cooking Utensils?

  A. Most do. Some models of course offer more storage space than
  others.

5. Q. Are Hot Pans Harmful to the Porcelain of the Work Surface of the
      Range?

  A. Yes. Sliding hot pans from the cooking unit to the porcelain work
  surface may result in scratches. An inexpensive pad may be used to
  protect the work surface.

6. Q. Will the Porcelain Surface of the Range Be Harmed By Large Pans
      Which Extend Over the Unit and Contact Directly?

  A. Yes. A good example of this is a large pressure cooker. The
  recessed bottom on some pressure cookers has caused considerable
  damage to the porcelain cooking top on ranges because the heating unit
  does not come in contact with the pressure cooker resulting in
  excessive temperatures adjacent to the surface unit. When such
  utensils must be used, it is well to raise the unit from the surface
  to insure direct contact.

  One make of Range has available a metal ring which slips in under the
  unit and raises it about 1 inch to prevent damage to the porcelain
  top.




                       Care of the Electric Range


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Q. Why Is It Easy to Keep Electric Ranges Clean?

  A. First, electricity is the cleanest of all fuels. Second, one piece
  ovens eliminate cracks and provide round corners—work surfaces with
  coved backs and cooking units that are easily removed for cleaning.
  Porcelain in itself is one of the easiest of all surfaces to clean.

2. Q. What Is the Best Way to Clean the Outer Surface of an Electric
      Range?

  A. First, let porcelain finished surfaces cool before cleaning.
  Second, wipe up spots as soon as possible. If porcelain is warm, use a
  dry cloth, never a wet one. Third, when porcelain is cool, wipe with a
  damp soapy cloth, rinse and dry well. Do not use gritty soaps or acid.

3. Q. Are There Any Precautions That Should Be Used in Cleaning an
      Electric Range?

  A. Yes. First, see that all switches are “Off.” Second, do not use
  abrasives or other cleaning materials that will scratch. Third, do not
  immerse electrical units in water. If these units become damp in
  cleaning, be sure that they are dry before connecting. Fourth, do not
  clean surface units while hot. Fifth, always soften hardened foods
  before removing as unnecessary scraping may damage any type of
  surface.

4. Q. What Is the Best Way to Clean the Oven?

  A. Always be sure the current is turned off and the oven is at least
  partially cooled. The interior is more easily cleaned with a damp
  cloth before the oven is entirely cooled. Be sure to remove shelves
  and heat units first and put them in a dry place. Wipe out the inside
  of the oven with a cloth wrung from soap water, rinse and dry well.
  Fine steel wool may be used to remove any food particles adhering to
  the surface. Spillovers which occur during baking or roasting may
  involve a little more difficulty in cleaning. If so, a cloth saturated
  with water to which household ammonia has been added may be placed
  over the soiled surface of the oven or “baffle” and allowed to remain
  for 20 minutes or an hour. Burned-on material may then be more easily
  removed by a cloth or fine steel wool without damaging glossy surface.

  Caution: Do not use the oven repeatedly after a spillover. This causes
  continual burning on of the food particles making them more difficult
  to remove, and in time will cause some damage to the glossy surface.

5. Q. What About Cleaning Under the Electric Range?

  A. This is seldom necessary. However, if it is, remove the lower
  utility drawers which gives access to the floor space below. If a
  thorough cleaning is desired, the range can be moved away from the
  wall where there is a long enough cord, or where it can be
  disconnected.

6. Q. What Happens When Hot Grease Spatters Out of the Frying Pan on to
      the Electric Range?

  A. Nothing. After cooking has been completed and the surface units
  have had time to cool completely, wash the surface with soap and
  water, rinse, and dry well. Note: If spattering occurs in excess
  during frying, you are using heat too high for this type of cooking
  operation. Review again the suggested heats for the different cooking
  operations on the surface units.

7. Q. What Is the Best Method of Cleaning the Broiler Pan?

  A. The broiler pan and rack should be washed just as any of your other
  cooking utensils. Place in water immediately after using and apply
  steel wool to any food which cannot be removed easily.

8. Q. Should the Surface of the Range be Waxed to Protect the Porcelain?

  A. No. Thorough cleaning and drying is the best protection you can
  give to that glossy porcelain.

9. Q. Is It Necessary to Place the Range Some Distance from the Wall to
      Prevent Soilage of the Paper?

  A. No—in fact the range can be placed as close to the wall as desired
  because oven vents are usually on the back panel and open towards the
  front, eliminating danger of soiling from the oven.

10. Q. How Are Spillovers Cleaned from the Surface Units?

  A. Most surface units are of the fully enclosed type and can be
  cleaned by merely brushing them off occasionally. The ring around the
  units should be cleaned with a damp cloth and soap powder.

11. Q. What Happens if Foods Spill Over on the Surface Unit?

  A. Nothing. They are caught by the reflector and the drip tray causing
  no damage to the unit. Wiring is so protected that no electrical
  problems are involved.

12. Q. How May the Drip Tray Be Cleaned?

  A. The drip tray which is located directly below the surface cooking
  units is easily removed and can be washed as any other utensil.

                  COOKING Guide for Frozen Vegetables


The cooking time for vegetables will vary somewhat, depending on
variety, state of maturity and how it has been prepared for freezing
(sliced, quartered, or whole). The following table is simply a guide to
help you in determining cooking time, based on one pound quantity,
cooked in covered utensil, starting in boiling water.

1. Frozen vegetables may be cooked without thawing. However, if they are
allowed to defrost partially, the frozen block can be easily broken up,
resulting in more even cooking. Complete thawing of vegetables before
cooking is not recommended.

2. Use covered cooking utensil—measure ½ to 1 cup of water, or enough to
cover bottom of utensil to depth of ⅛ to ¼ inch.

3. Start all vegetables on high heat in boiling water. Reduce heat when
active steaming is regained.

4. Keep all utensils tightly covered.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
